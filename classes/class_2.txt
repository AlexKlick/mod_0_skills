Class Customer_order
each customer order is contained within a hash table containing all of their dishes ordered, easily iterable and transfromed into JSON:
Customer_order ={dish_name => {
    prep_time_minutes => integer,
    price => float,
    ingredients => array,
    is_available => boolean
},
    next dish_name...
}

check_stock (the waiter checks with the chef to see if the ingredients available returning either true or false for is_available)

estimate_wait (based on the total prep_time_minutes for the dishes for the table, waiter returns to customer amount of time it should take before their meals are ready to serve)

bill_total (once the customer asks for the check, the waiter returns a bill by adding up the sum of prices for all items ordered)
